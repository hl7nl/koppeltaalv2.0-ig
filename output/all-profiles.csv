Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.

Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension itself).","There can be no stigma associated with the use of extensions by any application, project, or standard - regardless of the institution or jurisdiction that uses or defines the extensions.  The use of extensions is what allows the FHIR specification to retain a core level of simplicity for everyone.","Modifier extensions allow for extensions that *cannot* be safely ignored to be clearly distinguished from the vast majority of extensions which can be safely ignored.

This data type may be used to convey addresses for use in delivering mail as well as for visiting locations which might not be valid for mail delivery.  There are a variety of postal address formats defined around the world.","This datatype defines a common basis for expressing all addresses around the world, but adds extensions to express Dutch addresses specifically, according to the [zib AddressInformation v1.1 (2020)](https://zibs.nl/wiki/AddressInformation-v1.1(2020EN)). A Dutch Address still is a proper FHIR Address, which means that systems that cannot interpret the extensions will still be able to render and work with this datatype.

To have true compatibility an implementer SHOULD use the core Address parts as intended. To have addresses work for Dutch context, the implementer SHOULD in addition use the extension elements.

**Separate address parts**

The first addition is that Dutch addresses make certain address parts separately communicable. These parts are required for use in true Dutch systems when dealing with Dutch addresses, but may not have value for international systems when information gets sent abroad.

**Custom address types**

The second addition is that the zib defines its own ValueSet for address types, which can only be partially expressed using the FHIR Address datatype and requires a mapping to multiple elements. The table below explains how the zib concepts are mapped to the various FHIR elements (see the ConceptMaps <http://nictiz.nl/fhir/ConceptMap/AdresSoortCodelijst-to-AddressUse> and <http://nictiz.nl/fhir/ConceptMap/AdresSoortCodelijst-to-AddressType> as well). The code from the zib should also be included using the extension on `Address.extension:addressType`.

| zib                               | .ext:addressType | .use | .type    |
|-----------------------------------|------------------|------|----------|
| Postal Address/Postadres          | PST              |      | postal   |
| Primary Home/Officieel adres      | HP               | home | both     |
| Visit Address/Woon-/verblijfadres | PHYS             | home | physical |

| Work Place/Werkadres              | WP               | work |          |
| Vacation Home/Vakantie adres      | HV               | temp |          |

If `Address.type` is _both_ then this is to be understood as a dual purpose address (postal and physical), unless a specific _postal_ type address is added. Systems that support importing it like this are encouraged to do so, otherwise they may need to import this as two separate addresses.

Note: FHIR core defines the AD-use extension to further specify the postal address type. However, the ValueSet used in that extension doesn't completely match the zib ValueSet.

","AddressInformation","An address expressed using postal conventions (as opposed to GPS or other location definition formats).  This data type may be used to convey addresses for use in delivering mail as well as for visiting locations which might not be valid for mail delivery.  There are a variety of postal address formats defined around the world.","This datatype defines a common basis for expressing all addresses around the world, but adds extensions to express Dutch addresses specifically, according to the [zib AddressInformation v1.1 (2020)](https://zibs.nl/wiki/AddressInformation-v1.1(2020EN)). A Dutch Address still is a proper FHIR Address, which means that systems that cannot interpret the extensions will still be able to render and work with this datatype.

To have true compatibility an implementer SHOULD use the core Address parts as intended. To have addresses work for Dutch context, the implementer SHOULD in addition use the extension elements.

**Separate address parts**

The first addition is that Dutch addresses make certain address parts separately communicable. These parts are required for use in true Dutch systems when dealing with Dutch addresses, but may not have value for international systems when information gets sent abroad.

**Custom address types**

The second addition is that the zib defines its own ValueSet for address types, which can only be partially expressed using the FHIR Address datatype and requires a mapping to multiple elements. The table below explains how the zib concepts are mapped to the various FHIR elements (see the ConceptMaps <http://nictiz.nl/fhir/ConceptMap/AdresSoortCodelijst-to-AddressUse> and <http://nictiz.nl/fhir/ConceptMap/AdresSoortCodelijst-to-AddressType> as well). The code from the zib should also be included using the extension on `Address.extension:addressType`.

| zib                               | .ext:addressType | .use | .type    |
|-----------------------------------|------------------|------|----------|
| Postal Address/Postadres          | PST              |      | postal   |
| Primary Home/Officieel adres      | HP               | home | both     |
| Visit Address/Woon-/verblijfadres | PHYS             | home | physical |
| Temporary Address/Tijdelijk adres | TMP              | temp |          |
| Work Place/Werkadres              | WP               | work |          |
| Vacation Home/Vakantie adres      | HV               | temp |          |

If `Address.type` is _both_ then this is to be understood as a dual purpose address (postal and physical), unless a specific _postal_ type address is added. Systems that support importing it like this are encouraged to do so, otherwise they may need to import this as two separate addresses.

Note: FHIR core defines the AD-use extension to further specify the postal address type. However, the ValueSet used in that extension doesn't completely match the zib ValueSet. Therefore, a custom extension has been made. This doesn't preclude the use of the AD-use extension.","May need to keep track of a contact party's address for contacting, billing or reporting requirements.","","","","","","","",,,,,"",,,,"Organization.contact.address",0,1,"ele-1

A Dutch name is represented in FHIR as an ordinary international name, but is augmented using extensions to specify how the last name is built up according to the Dutch rules. See the guidance on `.family` and on `.extension:nameUsage` for more information. Systems that need to work in a Dutch context **MUST** support these extensions as specified here. In addition, systems SHOULD use the core elements according to the FHIR specifications to provide compatibility outside Dutch contexts. It is encouraged to provide a representation of the full name in the `.text` element.

**Note 1**: The zib cannot be represented straightforward in FHIR. Especially note the guidance on `.given` on how to map the FirstNames and Initials concepts, and on `.prefix`/`.suffix` on how to map the Titles concept.

","FirstName / Initial","One of a person’s official first names or the initial if the full name is not known.","This element represents the FirstNames and Initials concepts of zib NameInformation, but the FHIR implementation deviates from the zib model. The zib defines these concepts as a list of official first names (as a single string) and a list of initials (as a single string), both optional. They both represent the official name(s) of a person and thus represent the same concept. In FHIR however, each first name is either a complete name or an initial, but not both. In addition, each name may be defined separately.

Therefore, the zib concepts are implemented here in the following way:

* Systems SHOULD use a `.given` element for each official first name that they know of (either as a full name or an initial), in order of appearance (as specified by FHIR).
* Each of these elements:
  * SHOULD be populated with the complete name if it is known, or with the initial if no more information is available.
  * SHALL be augmented with `extension:givenOrInitial` with code _BR_ when it represents a full name or code _IN_ when it represents an initial.

Initials should thus not be communicated for each complete first name that is known, in contrast to what is specified by the zib. Receiving systems can recreate initials from the full names if needed.

If a system _does_ however only have a list of official first names and a separate list of official initials, without knowing the relationship between these two, only the full names SHOULD be communicated, while an additional `.name` instance MAY be used to communicate the initials. It is expected that the second instance just contains the initials and no other information from the zib. Receiving systems MAY ignore the second instance.

**Note 1:** The GivenName concept should not be included here but in a separate `.name` instance where `.use` = _usual_.

**Note 2**: As specified by FHIR, multiple official first names MAY be combined in a single `.given` element (separated by spaces), as long as the `.given` elements can be concatenated to form the full first name representation, and the 'extension:givenOrInitial` is used to mark the element as containing either full names or the initials. This pattern is strongly discouraged as it is hard to determine if the value pertains multiple names or a single combined name containing spaces.","","","","","","","","",,,,,"",,,,"HumanName.given",0,*,"","ele-1:All FHIR elements must have a @value or children {hasValue() or (children().count() > id.count())}

","AddressInformation","Patient's address information.","This datatype defines a common basis for expressing all addresses around the world, but adds extensions to express Dutch addresses specifically, according to the [zib AddressInformation v1.1 (2020)](https://zibs.nl/wiki/AddressInformation-v1.1(2020EN)). A Dutch Address still is a proper FHIR Address, which means that systems that cannot interpret the extensions will still be able to render and work with this datatype.

To have true compatibility an implementer SHOULD use the core Address parts as intended. To have addresses work for Dutch context, the implementer SHOULD in addition use the extension elements.

**Separate address parts**

The first addition is that Dutch addresses make certain address parts separately communicable. These parts are required for use in true Dutch systems when dealing with Dutch addresses, but may not have value for international systems when information gets sent abroad.

**Custom address types**

The second addition is that the zib defines its own ValueSet for address types, which can only be partially expressed using the FHIR Address datatype and requires a mapping to multiple elements. The table below explains how the zib concepts are mapped to the various FHIR elements (see the ConceptMaps <http://nictiz.nl/fhir/ConceptMap/AdresSoortCodelijst-to-AddressUse> and <http://nictiz.nl/fhir/ConceptMap/AdresSoortCodelijst-to-AddressType> as well). The code from the zib should also be included using the extension on `Address.extension:addressType`.

| zib                               | .ext:addressType | .use | .type    |
|-----------------------------------|------------------|------|----------|
| Postal Address/Postadres          | PST              |      | postal   |
| Primary Home/Officieel adres      | HP               | home | both     |
| Visit Address/Woon-/verblijfadres | PHYS             | home | physical |
| Temporary Address/Tijdelijk adres | TMP              | temp |          |
| Work Place/Werkadres              | WP               | work |          |
| Vacation Home/Vakantie adres      | HV               | temp |          |

If `Address.type` is _both_ then this is to be understood as a dual purpose address (postal and physical), unless a specific _postal_ type address is added. Systems that support importing it like this are encouraged to do so, otherwise they may need to import this as two separate addresses.

Note: FHIR core defines the AD-use extension to further specify the postal address type. However, the ValueSet used in that extension doesn't completely match the zib ValueSet. Therefore, a custom extension has been made. This doesn't preclude the use of the AD-use extension.","May need to keep track of patient addresses for contacting, billing or reporting requirements and also to help with identification.","","","","","","","",,,,,"",,,,"Patient.address",0,*,"ele-1

","FirstName / Initial","One of a person’s official first names or the initial if the full name is not known.","This element represents the FirstNames and Initials concepts of zib NameInformation, but the FHIR implementation deviates from the zib model. The zib defines these concepts as a list of official first names (as a single string) and a list of initials (as a single string), both optional. They both represent the official name(s) of a person and thus represent the same concept. In FHIR however, each first name is either a complete name or an initial, but not both. In addition, each name may be defined separately.

Therefore, the zib concepts are implemented here in the following way:

* Systems SHOULD use a `.given` element for each official first name that they know of (either as a full name or an initial), in order of appearance (as specified by FHIR).
* Each of these elements:
  * SHOULD be populated with the complete name if it is known, or with the initial if no more information is available.
  * SHALL be augmented with `extension:givenOrInitial` with code _BR_ when it represents a full name or code _IN_ when it represents an initial.

Initials should thus not be communicated for each complete first name that is known, in contrast to what is specified by the zib. Receiving systems can recreate initials from the full names if needed.

If a system _does_ however only have a list of official first names and a separate list of official initials, without knowing the relationship between these two, only the full names SHOULD be communicated, while an additional `.name` instance MAY be used to communicate the initials. It is expected that the second instance just contains the initials and no other information from the zib. Receiving systems MAY ignore the second instance.

**Note 1:** The GivenName concept should not be included here but in a separate `.name` instance where `.use` = _usual_.

**Note 2**: As specified by FHIR, multiple official first names MAY be combined in a single `.given` element (separated by spaces), as long as the `.given` elements can be concatenated to form the full first name representation, and the 'extension:givenOrInitial` is used to mark the element as containing either full names or the initials. This pattern is strongly discouraged as it is hard to determine if the value pertains multiple names or a single combined name containing spaces.","","","","","","","","",,,,,"",,,,"HumanName.given",0,*,"","ele-1:All FHIR elements must have a @value or children {hasValue() or (children().count() > id.count())}

","AddressInformation","An address expressed using postal conventions (as opposed to GPS or other location definition formats).  This data type may be used to convey addresses for use in delivering mail as well as for visiting locations which might not be valid for mail delivery.  There are a variety of postal address formats defined around the world.","This datatype defines a common basis for expressing all addresses around the world, but adds extensions to express Dutch addresses specifically, according to the [zib AddressInformation v1.1 (2020)](https://zibs.nl/wiki/AddressInformation-v1.1(2020EN)). A Dutch Address still is a proper FHIR Address, which means that systems that cannot interpret the extensions will still be able to render and work with this datatype.

To have true compatibility an implementer SHOULD use the core Address parts as intended. To have addresses work for Dutch context, the implementer SHOULD in addition use the extension elements.

**Separate address parts**

The first addition is that Dutch addresses make certain address parts separately communicable. These parts are required for use in true Dutch systems when dealing with Dutch addresses, but may not have value for international systems when information gets sent abroad.

**Custom address types**

The second addition is that the zib defines its own ValueSet for address types, which can only be partially expressed using the FHIR Address datatype and requires a mapping to multiple elements. The table below explains how the zib concepts are mapped to the various FHIR elements (see the ConceptMaps <http://nictiz.nl/fhir/ConceptMap/AdresSoortCodelijst-to-AddressUse> and <http://nictiz.nl/fhir/ConceptMap/AdresSoortCodelijst-to-AddressType> as well). The code from the zib should also be included using the extension on `Address.extension:addressType`.

| zib                               | .ext:addressType | .use | .type    |
|-----------------------------------|------------------|------|----------|
| Postal Address/Postadres          | PST              |      | postal   |
| Primary Home/Officieel adres      | HP               | home | both     |
| Visit Address/Woon-/verblijfadres | PHYS             | home | physical |
| Temporary Address/Tijdelijk adres | TMP              | temp |          |
| Work Place/Werkadres              | WP               | work |          |
| Vacation Home/Vakantie adres      | HV               | temp |          |

If `Address.type` is _both_ then this is to be understood as a dual purpose address (postal and physical), unless a specific _postal_ type address is added. Systems that support importing it like this are encouraged to do so, otherwise they may need to import this as two separate addresses.

Note: FHIR core defines the AD-use extension to further specify the postal address type. However, the ValueSet used in that extension doesn't completely match the zib ValueSet. Therefore, a custom extension has been made. This doesn't preclude the use of the AD-use extension.","The home/mailing address of the practitioner is often required for employee administration purposes, and also for some rostering services where the start point (practitioners home) can be used in calculations.","","","","","","","",,,,,"",,,,"Practitioner.address",0,*,"ele-1
