","FirstName / Initial","One of a person’s official first names or the initial if the full name is not known.","This element represents the FirstNames and Initials concepts of zib NameInformation, but the FHIR implementation deviates from the zib model. The zib defines these concepts as a list of official first names (as a single string) and a list of initials (as a single string), both optional. They both represent the official name(s) of a person and thus represent the same concept. In FHIR however, each first name is either a complete name or an initial, but not both. In addition, each name may be defined separately.

Therefore, the zib concepts are implemented here in the following way:

* Systems SHOULD use a `.given` element for each official first name that they know of (either as a full name or an initial), in order of appearance (as specified by FHIR).
* Each of these elements:
  * SHOULD be populated with the complete name if it is known, or with the initial if no more information is available.
  * SHALL be augmented with `extension:givenOrInitial` with code _BR_ when it represents a full name or code _IN_ when it represents an initial.

Initials should thus not be communicated for each complete first name that is known, in contrast to what is specified by the zib. Receiving systems can recreate initials from the full names if needed.

If a system _does_ however only have a list of official first names and a separate list of official initials, without knowing the relationship between these two, only the full names SHOULD be communicated, while an additional `.name` instance MAY be used to communicate the initials. It is expected that the second instance just contains the initials and no other information from the zib. Receiving systems MAY ignore the second instance.

**Note 1:** The GivenName concept should not be included here but in a separate `.name` instance where `.use` = _usual_.

**Note 2**: As specified by FHIR, multiple official first names MAY be combined in a single `.given` element (separated by spaces), as long as the `.given` elements can be concatenated to form the full first name representation, and the 'extension:givenOrInitial` is used to mark the element as containing either full names or the initials. This pattern is strongly discouraged as it is hard to determine if the value pertains multiple names or a single combined name containing spaces.","","","","","","","","",,,,,"",,,,"HumanName.given",0,*,"","ele-1:All FHIR elements must have a @value or children {hasValue() or (children().count() > id.count())}

","AddressInformation","Patient's address information.","This datatype defines a common basis for expressing all addresses around the world, but adds extensions to express Dutch addresses specifically, according to the [zib AddressInformation v1.1 (2020)](https://zibs.nl/wiki/AddressInformation-v1.1(2020EN)). A Dutch Address still is a proper FHIR Address, which means that systems that cannot interpret the extensions will still be able to render and work with this datatype.

To have true compatibility an implementer SHOULD use the core Address parts as intended. To have addresses work for Dutch context, the implementer SHOULD in addition use the extension elements.

**Separate address parts**

The first addition is that Dutch addresses make certain address parts separately communicable. These parts are required for use in true Dutch systems when dealing with Dutch addresses, but may not have value for international systems when information gets sent abroad.

**Custom address types**

The second addition is that the zib defines its own ValueSet for address types, which can only be partially expressed using the FHIR Address datatype and requires a mapping to multiple elements. The table below explains how the zib concepts are mapped to the various FHIR elements (see the ConceptMaps <http://nictiz.nl/fhir/ConceptMap/AdresSoortCodelijst-to-AddressUse> and <http://nictiz.nl/fhir/ConceptMap/AdresSoortCodelijst-to-AddressType> as well). The code from the zib should also be included using the extension on `Address.extension:addressType`.

| zib                               | .ext:addressType | .use | .type    |
|-----------------------------------|------------------|------|----------|
| Postal Address/Postadres          | PST              |      | postal   |
| Primary Home/Officieel adres      | HP               | home | both     |
| Visit Address/Woon-/verblijfadres | PHYS             | home | physical |
| Temporary Address/Tijdelijk adres | TMP              | temp |          |
| Work Place/Werkadres              | WP               | work |          |
| Vacation Home/Vakantie adres      | HV               | temp |          |

If `Address.type` is _both_ then this is to be understood as a dual purpose address (postal and physical), unless a specific _postal_ type address is added. Systems that support importing it like this are encouraged to do so, otherwise they may need to import this as two separate addresses.

Note: FHIR core defines the AD-use extension to further specify the postal address type. However, the ValueSet used in that extension doesn't completely match the zib ValueSet. Therefore, a custom extension has been made. This doesn't preclude the use of the AD-use extension.","May need to keep track of patient addresses for contacting, billing or reporting requirements and also to help with identification.","","","","","","","",,,,,"",,,,"Patient.address",0,*,"ele-1
